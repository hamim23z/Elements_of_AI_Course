Exercises

1. A spreadsheet that calculates sums and other pre-defined functions on given data
	- I said that this is not AI because we technically have to make the function that calculates the sum and whatnot. 
	- CORRECT


2. Predicting the stock market by fitting a curve to past data about stock prices
	- I said kind of AI because although no one can predict how and what will happen to the stock prices and stock market, there can be AI
	that can help make some better supported decisions. Like it can make the right decision at time and can predict it but not always will be
	correct.
	- CORRECT


3. A GPS navigation system for finding the fastest route. 
	- I said that this is AI because it clearly has to take in a bunch of data and then it predicts how long it will take based on that data and
	constantly do updates on the time. Google Maps does this all the time. 
	- CORRECT


4. A music recommendation system such as Spotify that suggests music based on the users' listening behavior
	- I said that this is AI because its literally taking in your past music taste and generating some new songs for you. 
	- CORRECT


5. Big data storage solutions that can store huge amounts of data (such as images or video) and stream them to many users at the same time
	- I said that this is not AI because we are just storing the data and then just showing it on the frontend, there is no use of AI here at all
	and the data is just "static"
	- CORRECT


6. Photo editing features such as brightness and contrast in applications such as Photoshop
	- I said that this is kind of AI because yes there is actual software to do this and not AI but there are some sites that now have an AI feature
	for this and at times it is better. 
	- CORRECT


7. Style transfer filters in applications such as Prisma that take a photo and transform it into different art styles (impressionist, cubist, ...)
	- I said that this is kind of AI because of number 6 but that was wrong. SO, this takes image stats and learns them, and then it transforms the input
	photo so that its stats match the style and the system can adapt to the desired art style. 
	- INCORRECT. 

Total Score: 6/7
