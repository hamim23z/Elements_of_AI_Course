## Section 1.2 Notes - Related Fields
The fields machine learning, datascience, and deep learning are closely related to AI. The way its interpreted is that we have the main field of CS, and then AI, and then ML. <br>
CS -> AI -> ML -> DL

**Machine Learning**: systems that improve their performance in a given task with more data/experience. 
<br>
**Deep Learning**: covered more later but for now it refers to the complexity of a math model. More computing power means more complexity. 
**Data Science**: include ML, stats, some CS. Its also a field to study and a career path.
