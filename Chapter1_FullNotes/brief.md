## Section 1.2 Notes - Related Fields
The fields machine learning, datascience, and deep learning are closely related to AI. The way its interpreted is that we have the main field of CS, and then AI, and then ML. <br>
CS -> AI -> ML -> DL

**Machine Learning**: systems that improve their performance in a given task with more data/experience. 
<br>
**Deep Learning**: covered more later but for now it refers to the complexity of a math model. More computing power means more complexity. 
**Data Science**: include ML, stats, some CS. Its also a field to study and a career path.

## Section 1.3 Notes - Philosophy of AI

General (AGI) vs Narrow AI. So narrow AI is the one that we use to this day, it is AI that can perform one task. General AI or Artifical General Intelligence is what is impossible, 
it can handle more than one task and can essentially handle anything. <br>

The conversation of intelligence is brought up a lot in AI. Think of it like this (these are my words not the course), lets say an AI chatbot is having a conversation with someone, and its
a double blind test. The person talking has to decide if its AI or not. However, the chatbot talks like a human, literally, it says things like "Yo", "What's up", and it makes silly errors
and asks questions back. One may think this is a human. But is it really intelligent if it gets these questions wrong and sends error? Is intelligence measured as how correct you are or if you
can mimic human behaviour? And thats a big question in the field of AI.
