Exercise 2 - Taxonomy of AI

So looking at the diagram on the website, it is asking to make a taxonomy in the Euler diagram example showing the relationships
of all the following: AI, ML, CS, DS, and DL. 

1. Where would you put AI?
	- Section B because AI is part of CS. 
	- CORRECT


2. Where would you put machine learning?
	- Section C because ML is part of AI which is part of CS.
	- CORRECT 


3. Where would you put computer science?
	- Section A because its the main one. 
	- CORRECT


4. Where would you put data science?
	- Section E because although its closely related to CS, it can be its own field more so. 
	- CORRECT


5. Where would you put deep learning?
	- Section D because DL is part of ML which is part of AI which is part of CS. 
	- CORRECT

TOTAL SCORE: 5/5

Exercise 3 - Examples of Tasks

1. Autonomous car
	- I said Stats, Robots, ML because for obvious reasons. 
	- CORRECT. 


2. Steering a rocket into orbit
	- I said Stats, Robots, and ML because stats to calculate trajectory and data and whatnot. Robots because
	we need it. And ML to improve over time. 
	- WRONG BUT IT SAID NO CORRECT ANSWER BC IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE INTERPRET IT


3. Online ad optimization
	- I said Stats and ML because we need stats and ML needed to improve the ads we see. 
	- CORRECT


4. Customer service chatbot
	- I said ML. We dont need stats here. It is just ML to focus on. A customer service chatbot will need machine learning 
	to process human produced language in such a way that it can act on it.
	- CORRECT


5. Summarizing gallup results
	- Whats a gallup? 
	- Summarizing gallup results is a classical case of using statistics to produce insights.

TOTAL SCORE: 4/5
